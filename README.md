# wjsoncleaner-and-formatter
This extension aims at easily cleaning and formatting JSON files we may found daily working on our project.

On a daily basis we are seeing some strange scaped caracters in the files or copy pastes we make from GRAFANA platform. 
We may need to change the way we work, but I'm making an small extension for VSCode to cleand and format the files

Building the extension on my own free time so I defenitely learn some JS/TS and help my peers
